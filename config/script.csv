Maze	Level1	2_2	birds	sequence	Hi! I need to get the bad piggie! Stack a couple of &quot;move forward&quot; blocks together and press &quot;Run Program&quot; to help me get there. 	
Maze	Level2	2_1	birds	sequence	Write me another program so I can make it all the way to the pig. 	
Maze	Level3	2_3	birds	sequence	How should I get to the pig? (Watch out for TNT)	
Maze	Level4	2_4	birds	sequence	Argh! Write me a program that gets me past the obstacles and to the pig. 	
Maze	Level5	2_5	birds	loop_times	There's a way I can get to the pig using only 2 blocks. Can you figure it out?	
Maze	Level6	2_6	birds	loop_times	Try to get me to the pig using only three blocks.	
Maze	Level7	2_7	birds	loop_times	Write me a program so I can get to the pig using the fewest number of blocks. Try using more than one &quot;repeat times&quot; block.	
Maze	Level8	2_8	birds	loop_times	Use a couple of &quot;repeat times&quot; blocks to get me to the pig!	
Maze	Level9	2_9	birds	loop_until	Ok, try the new &quot;repeat until&quot; block - it will repeat until I reach the pig.	
Maze	Level10	2_10	birds	loop_until	Ok, one last time for practice - can you get me to the pig in only 3 blocks?	
Maze	Level11	2_11	pvz	loop_until	Hello.  Me zombie. Me hungry. Must... get... to sunflower... Can you get me there with only 5 blocks?	
Maze	Leve12	2_12	pvz	loop_until	Ok, this is similar, but slightly different. Can you do it in only 5 blocks?	
Maze	Level13	2_13	pvz	if, loop_until	Use the new &quot;if&quot; block to let me decide when to turn. Hint: you only need one more block, but learn how we set it up so you can do it on your own next time.	
Maze	Level14	2_14	pvz	if, loop_until	Ok, this is just like the last level, but you need to remember how you used the &quot;if&quot; block and the &quot;repeat&quot; block together.	
Maze	Level15	2_15	pvz	if, loop_until	Me want sunflower! Use an &quot;if&quot; block to get me there with the fewest number of blocks.	
Maze	Level16	2_16	pvz	if, loop_until	Ok, let's do that again for practice - this isn't very different, but watch out for the chompers!	
Maze	Level17	2_17	pvz	if_else, loop_until	The &quot;If-else&quot; blocks checks a condition, and then does one thing OR another. To get me to the sunflower try to use this new block.	
Maze	Level18	2_18	pvz	if_else, loop_until	One more practice of the &quot;if-else&quot; block, can you get it right on your first try?	
Maze	Level19	2_19	pvz	if_else, loop_until	Can you add just 3 blocks to help me solve a more complex maze? If you do it right, I can walk any curvy path no matter the length.	
Artist	Level1	1_1	artist	sequence	Hi, I'm an artist. You can write code to make me draw almost anything. Use a few blocks to make me draw over the gray lines in the picture.	
Artist	Level2	1_2	artist	sequence	Now, draw a square. NOTE: use multiple different colors using the new &quot;set color&quot; block.	
Artist	Level3	1_3	artist	loop_times	Make a square using only 3 blocks.  (Blocks to set color are free, so use them if you want)	
Artist	Level4	1_4	artist	loop_times	Draw a triangle whose sides are all in different colors, using the &quot;random color&quot; option that picks a different color each time. Hint: You'll have to figure out how far to turn.	
Artist	Level5	1_5	artist	loop_times	Now, for practice, draw a triangle and then a square to draw an envelope.	
Artist	Level6	1_6	artist	loop_times	Can you figure out how draw this triangle and square? Hint: Do the triangle first, then figure out how much to turn before drawing the square.	
Artist	Level7	1_7	artist	loop_times	Ok, let's make it a bit harder - see if you can draw these green glasses. The squares are 100 dots on each side, and they're 50 dots apart. Don't forget to draw in green!	
Artist	Level8	1_8	artist	loop_times	Ok, try to figure out what happens if you run this code (or press &quot;Run&quot; to try it). Then, repeat it enough times to complete the drawing. The colors will be different every time.	
Artist	Level9	1_9	artist	loop_times	Can you figure out what number to replace the question marks with to draw a circle?	
Artist	Level10	1_10	artist	sequence	You made it! Now, draw anything you want. Some fun ideas: a stick figure, snowflake, or spiral.  Also try the new &quot;set width&quot; block.  Have fun!	
Artist2	Level1	4_1	artist	sequence	Now you have learned how to draw different shapes, can you create a program that draws the house you made with tangram pieces?	
Artist2	Level1	4_2	artist	sequence	Now you have learned how to draw different shapes, can you create a program that draws the square you made with two triangles?	
Artist2	Level1	4_3	artist	sequence	Now you have learned how to draw different shapes, can you create a program that draws the arrow you made with tangram pieces?	
Artist2	Level1	4_4	artist	sequence	Now you have learned how to draw different shapes, can you create a program that draws the ship you made with tangram pieces?	
Farmer	Level1	karel_1_1	farmer	sequence	Hi, I'm a farmer. I need your help to flatten the field on my farm so it's ready for planting. Move me to the pile of dirt and use the &quot;remove&quot; block to remove it.	
Farmer	Level2	karel_1_2	farmer	sequence	Next, move me to the hole and fill it with TWO shovelfuls of dirt, using the &quot;fill&quot; block.	
Farmer	Level3	karel_1_3	farmer	loop_times	Move me to the pile of dirt and tell me how many shovelfuls to remove using as few blocks as possible.	
Farmer	Level4	karel_1_4	farmer	loop_times	Can you help me remove all four piles of dirt? Hint: use a repeat block if you can	
Farmer	Level5	karel_1_5	farmer	loop_while, loop_times	Help me fill in all these holes with 5 shovelfuls of dirt. Hint: you can put a &quot;repeat&quot; block inside the &quot;while&quot; block.	
Farmer	Level6	karel_1_6	farmer	loop_while, loop_times	Remove all the piles of dirt, using as few blocks as possible. The new options in the dropdown menu on the &quot;while&quot; block tell me if I'm standing on a pile or a hole	
Farmer	Level7	karel_1_7	farmer	loop_while	Wow, I found a really deep hole! I don't know how many shovelfuls of dirt it needs. Can you write a program that fills it until it's even?	
Farmer	Level8	karel_1_8	farmer	loop_while	Help me fill in the hole at the end of the field, using as few blocks as possible.	
Farmer	Level9	karel_1_9	farmer	loop_while	Make me remove all these piles of dirt. Try to use as few blocks as possible. Hint: you can use a &quot;while&quot; block inside a &quot;repeat&quot; block.	
Farmer	Level10	karel_1_10	farmer	if, loop_while	I'm working late, so it's dark out, and I can't tell how large the piles are. Now I don't have all the options I used to have on the while block. Move me along the field, and if there is a pile, remove it.	
Farmer	Level11	karel_1_11	farmer	if, loop_while	It's still dark outside. Move me along the field. If there is a pile, remove it, and if there is a hole, fill it in. Hint: use the dropdown menu of options on the &quot;if&quot; block.	
Artist3	Level1	2_1	artist_zombie	loop_times	Hello. Me zombie artist. Me love drawing! Help me draw a square in a special color. Important note: you have all the same blocks but they've now been arranged in categories.	
Artist3	Level2	2_2	artist_zombie	loop_times	Welcome to using functions! Try the new &quot;draw a square&quot; block, found in the &quot;Functions&quot; category, to draw a small 50x50 green square.	
Artist3	Level3	2_3	artist_zombie	loop_times	Use the &quot;repeat&quot; block (in the &quot;Loops&quot; category) to draw 3 squares of size 100, each 120 degrees apart. And do it in 3 different, random colors.	
Artist3	Level4	2_4	artist_zombie	loop_times	Now we're going to get fancy. Change the code to draw 36 squares, 100 dots wide, and each 10 degrees apart. Hint: you may want to use the slider to make me go faster.	
Artist3	Level5	2_5	artist_zombie	sequence	Draw squares with sides of 50, 60, 70, 80, and 90 dots.  You'll need to use the &quot;draw a square&quot; function five times.	
Artist3	Level6	2_6	artist_zombie	loop_for	Ok, this program will use a counter, to draw the same squares as last time. You want the square to be the same size as the counter, so use the &quot;counter&quot; block. Hint: It's in the Variables category.	
Artist3	Level7	2_7	artist_zombie	loop_for	Here's a program to draw a spiral, but the blocks are disabled so they won't run. Make a new program using a &quot;count with&quot; block (in the Loops category) and &quot;counter&quot; block (in the Variables category) to draw the same spiral.	
Artist3	Level8	2_8	artist_zombie	sequence	This one's a bit tricky. There's a new &quot;draw a snowman&quot; function (in the Functions category), and a &quot;jump forward&quot; block (in the Actions category). Draw 3 snowmen in different colors, 100 dots apart.	
Artist3	Level9	2_9	artist_zombie	loop_for	Use a &quot;count with&quot; loop to draw a family of snowmen with heights of 110, 100, 90, 80, and 70. The snowmen should all be 60 dots apart.	
Artist3	Level10	2_10	artist_zombie	sequence	here's some code to try experimenting with different spirals.  What happens if you change the turn amount? Or set a random color in the loop?  Draw anything you like.	
Farmer2	Level1	karel_2_1	farmer	sequence	Try using the blocks to help me remove all the piles and fill in all the holes on the ground. Try to use loops instead of using too many blocks. Hint: You can put a loop inside another loop.	
Farmer2	Level2	karel_2_2	farmer	function	We've defined our own block called &quot;fill 5&quot;, which is now in the Functions category. Use it to help me fill in this hole.	
Farmer2	Level3	karel_2_3	farmer	function, loop_times	Use the new &quot;fill 5&quot; function block to make me fill in all the holes.	
Farmer2	Level4	karel_2_4	farmer	function, loop_times	Define a new function that removes 7 shovelfuls. Then use it to write a program that helps me remove all the piles.	
Farmer2	Level5	karel_2_5	farmer	function, loop_times	Create a new function that removes 6 shovelfuls from a pile, and use it to help me level out all the piles.	
Farmer2	Level6	karel_2_6	farmer	function, loop_times	Use two new functions, &quot;fill 8&quot; and &quot;remove 8&quot;, to help me level out the pile and fill in the hole.	
Farmer2	Level7	karel_2_7	farmer	function	There's a cow in my field! Write a new function that helps me avoid the cow and remove the pile. Put all your blocks inside the new function.	
Farmer2	Level8	karel_2_8	farmer	function, loop_while	Use this new function, &quot;avoid the cow and remove 1&quot;, to help me remove all the piles.	
Farmer2	Level9	karel_2_9	farmer	if, function, loop_while	Ok, here's a function that removes 4 different piles of dirt in a vertical column. Try putting this function inside a loop, so that you remove all the piles of dirt using only a few new blocks.	
Farmer2	Level10	karel_2_10	farmer	if, function, loop_while	Move me across the field, and use these two functions to help me remove all the piles and fill all the holes.	
Artist4	Level1	3_1	artist_zombie	function	This level shows you how the &quot;draw a square&quot; and &quot;draw a circle&quot; functions are defined.  Defining a function doesn't run its blocks.  You have to pull out the &quot;draw a square&quot; block to actually draw a square.	
Artist4	Level2	3_2	artist_zombie	function	Using the &quot;draw a square&quot; function as an example, create a &quot;draw a triangle&quot; function and use it.	
Artist4	Level3	3_3	artist_zombie	function, loop_times	Draw triangular fences around the cats and a square fence around the cow.  Tip: Test the program as you go along.	
Artist4	Level4	3_4	artist_zombie	function	See if you can figure out how to use &quot;draw a square&quot; and &quot;draw a triangle&quot; (and some other blocks) to draw a house around the lion.	
Artist4	Level5	3_5	artist_zombie	function	Now create a new &quot;draw a house&quot; function and use it to house two cats. Hint: create a new function using the &quot;do something&quot; block, and type your own text to name the block.	
Artist4	Level6	3_6	artist_zombie	parameters	Using &quot;draw a square&quot; as an example, add an input named &quot;length&quot; to &quot;draw a triangle&quot;. Then, draw triangles in different sizes.  (Hint: click the star to add an input to a function)	
Artist4	Level7	3_7	artist_zombie	parameters	Add an input named &quot;height&quot; to &quot;draw a house&quot; and build a big house for the elephant (with edges 150 dots long)	
Artist4	Level8	3_8	artist_zombie	parameters	Here are all of the blocks from the previous level.  Modify &quot;draw a house&quot; so I end up at the bottom right corner after drawing a new house.  Use this modified function to draw three houses.	
Artist4	Level9	3_9	artist_zombie	parameters	Can you re-create the &quot:draw a house&quot; function without help? Try it, and then draw a row of houses.	
Artist4	Level10	3_10	artist_zombie	sequence	You've learned a lot! Now use it to draw whatever you want.  Try to draw a star, or a spiral, or a fancy snowflake.	
Farmer3	Level1	karel_debug_seq_1	farmer	sequence	Welcome to debugging! My code doesn't work right. Can you spot the problem and fix it so that I can get my field flat and ready for planting?	
Farmer3	Level2	karel_debug_seq_2	farmer	sequence	What's wrong with this program? How should you fix it so I can remove that pile?	
Farmer3	Level3	karel_debug_repeat	farmer	loop_times	De-bug this program for me so my field will be nice and flat.	
Farmer3	Level4	karel_debug_while	farmer	loop_while, loop_times	How should you change this program to help me fill the hole?	
Farmer3	Level5	karel_debug_if	farmer	if, loop_times	Help! Fix the program so my field will be completely flat.	
Farmer3	Level6	karel_debug_if_else	farmer	if_else, loop_times	De-bug this program so I can fill in the holes and remove all the piles.	
Farmer3	Level7	karel_debug_function_1	farmer	function	What should you change about this program to help me remove all the piles?	
Farmer3	Level8	karel_debug_function_2	farmer	function	Can you de-bug this program for me so I can make my field flat?	
Farmer3	Level9	karel_debug_function_3	farmer	parameters	Edit this program so I'll remove all the piles on my field. 	
Artist5	Level1	5_1	artist_zombie	sequence	Take this time to draw whatever you feel like!
